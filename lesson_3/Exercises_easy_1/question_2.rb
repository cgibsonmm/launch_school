# 2. Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# 1. what is != and where should you use it?
# 2. put ! before something, like !user_name
# 3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# 4. put ? before something
# 5. put ? after something
# 6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

# 1. != not equal to operator, you should use it when trying to find wether an object is not the same as something else.

# 2. ! changes it to opposite of boolean value

# 3. ""! if you see this you should expect the it to be destructive and changing what ever it is being called on.

# 4. ? before would checking if/else

# 5. ? after should mean you are checking to see if true

# 6. !
